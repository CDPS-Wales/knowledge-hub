# How to contribute to the Knowledge Hub

We are building the Knowledge Hub in public and we would like to encourage contributions from the community. 

The only thing you need to contribute to the Knowledge Hub is a Github account. You can sign up to GitHub by filling out the form [on this page](https://github.com/join).

Got it? Well done! You can now contribute to the Knowledge Hub in one of the following ways:

## Talk to us

The Knowledge Hub project on Github has its own forum. This forum can be used by anyone to: 

* report and discuss problems
* propose improvements and engage in discussions about improvements proposed by other contributors
* present ideas and discuss ideas presented by other contributors

For example:

Alice wants to report a mistake in one of the articles. She can do this by filling up the form [here](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/issues/new). This will create a new issue and she will be able to discuss the problem with the community and even offer suggestions about how to solve it.

Bob wants to propose an improvement to the Welsh language section in the Service Standards article. He searches for "Welsh language" [using the search bar](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/issues/2). Turns out that another contributor has already requested the same improvement. Bob clicks on the existing issue and adds a comment highlighting the importance of this issue for his team.

Claire stumbled upon a different knowledge-base project on the internet that is also bilingual. She thinks the language switcher in this project is nicer so she creates a new issue titled: "Improve Language Switcher", provides the link to the project she has discovered and includes some screenshots to help out people who want to engage with her idea.

## Help us

You are already helping us by talking to us. But if you want, you can also choose to roll-up your sleeves and take-on any [open issue](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/issues) in the project that you fancy. 

Most of the issues in Knowledge Hub do not require any coding skills to fix. Broadly, there are 2 types of issues:

### Edit a page

1. Go to the page that you want to edit. For example: you want to add a really nice example of working in public to the [service standards](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/blob/main/en/service-standard.markdown) page.

2. Click the Edit button near the top-right of the page. It has a ✏️ icon on it.

3. The pages are in [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). You can make any changes to the page at this point and hit the `Propose Changes` button.

4. GitHub will take you to a page where you can review the changes and create a pull request. If you are happy with your changes, please hit the `Create pull request` button.

5. Finally, you can create a pull request - which is the GitHub term for `proposed changes`. It is a good practice to write a summary for the changes before clicking the `Create pull request` button.

Thats it! You just proposed a change to a page in the Knowledge Hub. As soon as a member of the Knowledge Hub team approves your pull-request, your proposed changes would be merged into the project.

### Create a new page

Creating a new page is just as simple as editing an existing one.

1. Browse to the directory where you want the new file to be stored and select `Create new file` in the `Add file` dropdown like so:

2. You will find yourself on a page that is very similar to the one used to edit a page. You can choose a name for your file, write down what needs to go on there and hit the `Propose Change` button.

The rest of the workflow is exactly the same as `Edit a page`.
