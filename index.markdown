Welcome to the CDPS Knowledge Hub. The purpose of this website is to provide Welsh public sector staff access to:

* Current digital transformation activities
* Best and worst practice
* Common service standards around digital transformation

We are building this in public and we would like to encourage contributions from the community.

For starters, you can tell us:

* What you think about the Knowledge Hub?
* What you would like us to add next?
* Any problems with the content?

By [creating a new issue here](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/issues/new).

You can also help us fix some of these issues. We accept PRs from everyone. You do not need to know
coding for a bunch of these issues. We are in the process of labelling them so that you can pick something that you can help with.

You can see the [list of all the open issues here](https://github.com/alixedi/knowledge-hub/issues).
