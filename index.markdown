The CDPS Knowledge Hub exists to provide Welsh public sector staff access to:

* common service standards around digital transformation
* best practice advice
* current digital transformation activities

This is a prototype. We're building it in the open, and we welcome contributions from the community.

For starters, you can tell us:

* what you think the Knowledge Hub should do
* what content or topics you'd like to see included
* about changes you'd like to suggest
