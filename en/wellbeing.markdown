# Focus on current and future well-being of people in Wales


## Why it's important

User research showed that the Welsh context really matters to public sector staff in Wales.

Many people are proud to be able to work under the auspices of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act. It is seen as forward-looking, world-leading, and inspiring.

More importantly, it empowers people working in public sector jobs to make certain decisions in certain contexts. Where there is a clear benefit for future generations by choosing A over B, they are empowered to follow that path without further consultation. As a result, the Act helps to speed up decision making and service design.


## What it means

Teams should:



*   Know, and keep to hand, the [7 well-being goals](https://gov.wales/well-being-wales-2019), and refer to them when in doubt about high-level strategic decisions
*   Read the guidance around the [Well-being of Future Generations Act](https://gov.wales/well-being-future-generations-wales-act-2015-guidance)
*   Consider the Well-being Duty, set out by the Act, that they must "carry out sustainable development"
*   In practical terms, consider long-term consequences of their service design decisions. That includes thinking about accessibility, system architecture, technical requirements, service and content maintenance and iteration, Welsh language provision and financial commitment _over the long term_.
*   Design activities and processes to be just as sustainable as services and products.
*   Consider the role of the Future Generations Commissioner, and document their work as they go in a way that will be helpful if and when the Commissioner wishes to conduct a review.
